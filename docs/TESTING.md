# Testing Setup

This monorepo is equipped with comprehensive testing using Vitest. Each package and app has its own containerized testing setup using the shared `@repo/vitest-config` package.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests across the monorepo
bun run test

# Run tests in watch mode
bun run test:watch

# Run tests with UI
bun run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage
bun run test:coverage
```

## Merged Coverage Reports

The monorepo now supports unified coverage reporting across all packages and apps. When you run `bun run test:coverage`, the system will:

1. **Run tests with coverage** in all packages and apps
2. **Collect coverage reports** from each workspace
3. **Merge all reports** into a single unified report
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** in multiple formats

### Coverage Commands

```bash
# Run all tests with merged coverage (recommended)
bun run test:coverage

# Individual coverage collection steps (if needed)
bun run coverage:merge    # Collect and merge coverage files
bun run coverage:report   # Generate final reports
```

### Coverage Output

After running `bun run test:coverage`, you'll find:

- **Individual Coverage Summary**: Displayed in the terminal showing coverage for each package
- **Merged HTML Report**: `./coverage/report/index.html` - Interactive HTML report
- **LCOV Report**: `./coverage/report/lcov.info` - For CI/CD integration
- **Text Summary**: Displayed in terminal with overall coverage percentages

### Coverage Structure

```
coverage/
├── raw/                    # Individual package coverage files
│   ├── web-coverage.json
│   ├── api-coverage.json
│   ├── ui-coverage.json
│   └── ...
├── merged.json            # Merged coverage data

    ├── index.html         # Interactive HTML report
    ├── lcov.info          # LCOV format
    └── ...
```

## Package-Level Testing

Each package has its own test configuration and can be tested individually:

```bash
# Test specific packages
bun run test --filter=web
bun run test --filter=@repo/ui
bun run test --filter=@repo/directus-sdk
```

## Test Structure

### Shared Vitest Configuration (`@repo/vitest-config`)

- **Base Config**: Common settings for all packages
- **React Config**: Configuration for React component testing
- **Node Config**: Configuration for Node.js/backend testing
- **Next.js Config**: Special configuration for Next.js applications

## Test Types

### Unit Tests
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Utility function testing
- Type validation testing
- Middleware testing

### Integration Tests
- Cross-package import validation
- Configuration testing
- End-to-end workflow testing

### Mocking
- Next.js router and navigation
- External dependencies (lodash, etc.)
- Environment variables
- Network requests

## Coverage Reports

Coverage reports are generated in the `coverage/` directory for each package when running:

```bash
bun run test:coverage
```

## Configuration Files

Each package contains:
- `vitest.config.ts` - Vitest configuration
- `vitest.setup.ts` - Test setup and global mocks
- Test files with `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` extensions

## Continuous Integration

The test setup is designed to work with:
- Turborepo for efficient test execution
- Bun as the JavaScript runtime
- Parallel test execution across packages
- Dependency-aware test ordering

## Adding New Tests

1. Create test files alongside your source code in `__tests__/` directories
2. Use the appropriate vitest config from `@repo/vitest-config`
3. Follow the naming convention: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`
4. Import necessary testing utilities from vitest and @testing-library

Example test structure:
```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest'
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'

describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should render correctly', () => {
    // Test implementation
  })
})
```

## Best Practices

1. **Isolate tests**: Each test should be independent
2. **Mock external dependencies**: Use vi.mock() for external services
3. **Test behavior, not implementation**: Focus on what the code does
4. **Use descriptive test names**: Make tests self-documenting
5. **Organize by feature**: Group related tests together
6. **Clean up**: Use beforeEach/afterEach for setup and teardown
