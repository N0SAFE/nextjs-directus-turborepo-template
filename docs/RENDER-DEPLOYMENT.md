# Render Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Deploy your Next.js + Directus app to Render

### Prerequisites
- GitHub repository with your code
- Render account (free at render.com)

### Step-by-Step Deployment

#### 1. Sign Up and Connect Repository
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up (free)
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Grant access to your repository

#### 2. Deploy Using Blueprint (Recommended)
1. In Render dashboard, click **"New"** → **"Blueprint"**
2. Connect your repository
3. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file
4. Review the services that will be created:
   - **directus-api**: Your Directus CMS backend
   - **nextjs-web**: Your Next.js frontend
   - **directus-db**: PostgreSQL database (free tier)

#### 3. Update Service URLs
Before deploying, you need to update the URLs in `render.yaml`:

1. Replace `directus-api-yourname` with your chosen service name
2. Replace `nextjs-web-yourname` with your chosen service name

The URLs will be:
- API: `https://your-api-service-name.onrender.com`
- Web: `https://your-web-service-name.onrender.com`

#### 4. Deploy and Configure
1. Click **"Apply"** to start deployment
2. Wait for services to build and deploy (10-15 minutes)
3. Access your API at: `https://your-api-service.onrender.com`
4. Access your web app at: `https://your-web-service.onrender.com`

#### 5. Set Up Directus Admin
1. Go to your API URL
2. Complete Directus admin setup
3. Create content and collections as needed

### Deployment Optimizations

**Build Performance:**
- The web service Dockerfile builds the Next.js app during the Docker build phase
- This prevents Render from timing out while scanning for open ports
- Uses `SKIP_STATIC_GENERATION=true` to speed up the build process
- Static generation happens after the service starts to avoid build timeouts

**Health Checks:**
- Extended health check start period (120s) to allow for proper service initialization
- Health check endpoint configured at root path (`/`)
- Automatic retry mechanism for service stability

### Environment Variables

The blueprint automatically configures:
- Database connection
- CORS settings
- Authentication secrets
- Service URLs

### Manual Deployment (Alternative)

If you prefer manual setup:

#### Deploy Directus API:
1. New → Web Service
2. Connect repository
3. Docker environment
4. Dockerfile path: `./docker/Dockerfile.api.prod`
5. Add PostgreSQL database
6. Configure environment variables

#### Deploy Next.js Web:
1. New → Web Service  
2. Connect repository
3. Docker environment
4. Dockerfile path: `./docker/Dockerfile.web.prod`
5. Configure environment variables

### Free Tier Limitations

**Render Free Tier includes:**
- 750 hours/month web service usage
- Services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
- 90-day PostgreSQL database (then requires upgrade)
- 512MB RAM per service
- Shared CPU

**For production use:**
- Upgrade to paid plan ($7/month per service)
- Persistent database storage
- No sleep mode
- Better performance

### Troubleshooting

**Port scan timeout during deployment:**
- This issue occurs when the build process takes too long
- Our Dockerfile now builds the app during Docker build phase (not startup)
- Uses `SKIP_STATIC_GENERATION=true` to speed up builds
- If you still see timeouts, consider upgrading to a paid plan for faster builds

**Service won't start:**
- Check build logs in Render dashboard
- Verify Dockerfile paths in render.yaml
- Ensure all environment variables are set
- Wait for the health check start period (120s for web service)

**Database connection issues:**
- Verify PostgreSQL service is running
- Check database environment variables
- Wait for database to be fully initialized

**CORS errors:**
- Update CORS_ORIGIN in API service
- Ensure URLs match your actual service URLs

**Build takes too long:**
- The web service is configured with `SKIP_STATIC_GENERATION=true`
- Build happens during Docker build phase, not at startup
- Consider using a paid plan for faster build resources

### Custom Domains

Both services support custom domains:
1. Go to service settings in Render
2. Add custom domain
3. Configure DNS records as instructed

### Monitoring

Monitor your services:
- Check logs in Render dashboard
- Set up alerts for service health
- Monitor usage to avoid free tier limits

### Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Set up your Directus content model
2. Configure authentication in Next.js
3. Add custom domain (optional)
4. Set up monitoring and backups
5. Consider upgrading for production use
